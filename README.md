# project-library

_This week's exciting project is all about building a digital library, using an array of books, recipes or a data collection of your choice._

"You'll get to apply concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, function definitions, conditional statements, variable assignment, and object and array manipulation."

## The problem

The biggest issue was to apply the different functions to the elements in HTML. It's a lot easier to get an output in the console than to get the functions to work the way you want together with the actual elements.
There are still things I want to edit in the final version, like sorting the favorites according to the different values.
